GettingCleaningDataProject
==========================

This repository contains the R script file that processes data files from 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The goal is to combine training and test data into single data frame, and inlcude only mean and standard deviation features.

The script generates the processed data frame as well as a second data frame that contains average value of each variable for each subject and for each activity type.

Please refer to the run_analysis.R script for step-by-step processesing (code well commented)
